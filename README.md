Beauty Pulse AI â€” TrendSpotter + CommentSense
Lâ€™OrÃ©al x Monash Datathon 2025 | Team Code Kshatriya

Beauty Pulse AI is a web-based dashboard that helps identify emerging beauty trends and understand how audiences react to them. The project combines two modules:

TrendSpotter â†’ Detects rising and fading trends across platforms by analyzing hashtags, keywords, and engagement patterns.

CommentSense â†’ Evaluates audience feedback at scale by classifying sentiment, detecting spam, and scoring comment quality.

Our goal is to provide Lâ€™OrÃ©al with a clear, interactive tool that shows whatâ€™s trending, whoâ€™s talking about it, and when to act.
